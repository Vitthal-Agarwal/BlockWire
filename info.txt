Initialize a node.js project in this new directory by running the following command:
  npm init -y


Next, we’re going to install the JavaScript SDK, the dotenv dependency, and create index.js & .env files. 
If you’re wondering what dotenv is, it’s an NPM package that allows us to create environment variables within our project. We can reference these variables in our code so that we’re not hard-coding our account information into any of our project files. This comes in handy when we’re pushing code to a public GitHub repository and allows us to hide our sensitive information. 

  npm install --save @hashgraph/sdk

  npm install dotenv

  touch index.js .env

the command "touch index.js .env" will create a file named "index.js" and ".env"



Setting up Your .env File

Next, let’s create those environment variables I was talking about earlier. Click into your .env file and plug in the following code: 

MY_ACCOUNT_ID=ENTER TESTNET ACCOUNT ID 
MY_PRIVATE_KEY=DER ENCODED PRIVATE KEY

Note: when you’re plugging in your Account ID and your DER Encoded Private Key, don’t leave any spaces or use any quotation marks





Testing Your Environment Variables

Now let’s test out those environment variables using some JavaScript. Head over to your index.js file and plug in the following code: 

   //Imports the dotenv dependency and environment variables into your index.js file

require("dotenv").config();

   //Imports the hashgraph/sdk dependency along with some built in functionality that will be used later on in the tutorial

const { Client, PrivateKey, AccountCreateTransaction, AccountBalanceQuery, Hbar, TransferTransaction } = require("@hashgraph/sdk");

   //Important to note that you have to write async functions when leveraging the Hedera network

async function main() {

    //Grabs your Hedera testnet account ID and private key from your .env file and stores them to new variables

    const myAccountId = process.env.MY_ACCOUNT_ID;
    const myPrivateKey = process.env.MY_PRIVATE_KEY;

    // If we weren't able to grab it, we should throw a new error, otherwise you should see a "Success!" message

    if (!myAccountId || !myPrivateKey) {
        throw new Error("Environment variables MY_ACCOUNT_ID and MY_PRIVATE_KEY must be present");
    } else {
        console.log("Success!"); 
    }
}
    //Remember to invoke your function!

main();




I’ve commented out each line to help explain what everything does. Once you’ve gotten all that code into your index.js file, you can go ahead and run the program. 

  node index.js
